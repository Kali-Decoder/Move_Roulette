# APT-Casino

One of our team-mate was on etherscan exploring some transactions and saw an advertisement of [https://stake.com/](url) which was giving a 200% bonus on the first deposit, when our team-mate deposited the 120 USDT into this platform they gave him 360 USDT as total balance and when our teammate started playing game he was shocked to see that he was only able to play with $1 per game of Play Plinko Online - Pachinko Casino Game on Stake.com and was unable to increase the betting amount beyond $1 coz he was using the bonus scheme of 200% and when he tried to explore and play other games on the platform he got to know that this platform has cheated him under the name of wager limits.

When he tried to withdraw money they showed him this rule list of wager limits which said that if he wanted to withdraw the deposited amount then he had to play $12,300 worth of games this was a big shock for him when he was explained a maths logic by their live support. Thereby, In the hope of getting the deposited money back, he played the game Plinko the entire night and lost all his money.

He was very annoyed by this and that's how APT-Casino was born, which is a combination of AI, Gamefi and Defi all in one platform where new web3 users can play games, and perform gambling but have a safe, secure, transparent platform that does not scam any of their users. Also, we wanted to address common issues in traditional gaming platforms.

### Problem
The traditional online gambling industry is plagued by several issues, including:
- **Unfair Game Outcomes:** Many platforms manipulate game results, leading to unfair play.

- **High Fees:** Users face exorbitant fees for deposits, withdrawals, and gameplay.

- **Restrictive Withdrawal Policies:** Withdrawal limits and conditions often prevent users from accessing their funds.

- **Bonus Drawbacks:** Misleading bonus schemes trap users with unrealistic wagering requirements.

- **Lack of True Asset Ownership:** Centralized platforms retain control over user assets, limiting their freedom and security.

### Solution
 APT-Casino addresses these problems by offering:
- **Provably Fair Gaming:** Utilizing Chainlink VRF and Equito's secure data transfers to ensure transparent and fair game outcomes.

- **Low Fees and Flexible Policies:** Leveraging blockchain efficiency and Equito's scalable data transfers to minimize costs and remove withdrawal restrictions.

- **Cross-Chain Asset Transfers:** Leveraging Equito's interoperability, APT-Casino allows users to deposit and withdraw assets across multiple blockchain networks seamlessly. This enhances user convenience and expands the platform's accessibility.

- **Interoperable Smart Contracts:** By utilizing Equito's support for interoperable smart contracts, our games operate efficiently across different chains, ensuring low latency and high security.

- **Flexible Withdrawal Policies:** Providing users unrestricted funds access.

- **Transparent Bonus Schemes:** Clear and Clean bonus terms without hidden traps.

- **True Asset Ownership:** Decentralized asset management ensures users have full control over their assets.

### Key Features
**APT-Casino** offers a multifaceted platform with three main features:

**1. AI - Social Aspect:**
- Users create **AI-generated NFT profile pictures**based on keywords.
- View a **community leaderboard**.
- Cross-Chain Identity Verification: Equito enables secure identity features across different networks.

**2. GameFi - Gaming Aspect:**
- **APT-Casino** includes a fully functional **European roulette game**.
- Users can place various types of bets such as **straight, split, street, corner, six line, column, dozen, red, black, high, low, even, and odd.**
- The **roulette wheel** randomly generates winning values.**  Equito's secure messaging ensures game logic is executed reliably across chains.
- Winnings are automatically calculated and transferred to the user's wallet.

**3. Defi - Lending Aspect:**
- Users can **deposit any tokens on Equito supported chains as collateral to borrow in-game currency (APTC)** such that if the user holding is in Equito token and if the value of Equito token goes up by 10% in markets then the value of the collateral goes up by 10% and users can enjoy playing games/ gambling without facing any financial losses as the in-game currency(APTC) is stable and has nothing to deal with collateral but if the collateral value hits a negative threshold of -10% in 24 hours then the APTC token will also be deducted in a similar manner just like the case with mortgage NFT platform Ordinals.
- Facilitates gameplay without the need to sell existing holdings.
- Ensures players have the necessary assets to participate in games seamlessly using real-time asset prices.

**Diverse Game Selection:** A variety of fully on-chain games, including roulette, mines, wheel of luck, blackjack, plinko, and more. As a (POC) Proof of Concept we developed fully on-chain Roulette but a similar model can be applied to introduce the new casino games to the platform.

### Deployed Contracts:

Equito is used to transfer funds to other chains, So let's say you are playing games on opBNB Testnet right? So you need some in-game currency (APTC Token) on the opBNB Testnet to play that game but APT-Casino is deployed on Sepolia, so we are using EQUITO APP Contracts as cross-chain communication between the Sepolia and opBNB Testnet, and transfer your tokens on opBNB Testnet and at last you can plan any APT-Casino games by the help of APTC Token on any of the destination chain. So here we are using this Equito Cross-chain communication protocol to solve this problem.

As a Proof of Concept(POC) Sepolia to opBNB using Equito:

**Bridge contract deployed on Sepolia:**
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xee2b692e213982aae459f4024e4cef0374e5b065789d7c52416aa376a6a8c9c1

**opBNB contract deployed:**
https://opbnb-testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0xb852480857f76fa430ea515dc2b5502cf015af99ee58866e052ad1f6912d674d

**Sepolia to opBNB by use of Equito.**

### What's next
All though started as an idea but now we are thinking of carrying it forward as a business model and expanding further.

- Applying for Grants: Seeking funding to further develop and expand the platform.

- Mainnet Launch: Deploying on the mainnet for real-world use.

- User Testing: Conducting extensive user testing to refine the platform, we conducted 100 user testing on testnet.

- Promoting the Product: Marketing to attract a wider audience.

- Introducing new games to the platform.

- Explore additional DeFi features like staking, farming, yield strategies to offer more financial services within the platform.

- We aim to implement gasless transactions to enhance user convenience.

- Enabling Developers to build more transparent games in our platform, We can pivot our current platform to game launchpad too but we stick to the decisions of Equito judges, mentors and our future Equito advisors, angel investors, VCs and so on.

- Bringing in new monetization schemas to compensate the casino games/ game creators.

- Having an in-built live streaming, for gameplay we may utilize livepeer/ lens/ huddle01 for this feature and allow players to do streaming within the application.

- We also plan to introduce an in-game chat feature where gamblers/ gamers/ our users can chat and predict the outcome of the games so making its perspective and narrative towards SOCIALFI as well.

We want to be the biggest gamefi/ gambling / games hub centre of the gaming and gambling industry.

By integrating Equito's cross-chain interoperability protocol, APT-Casino not only addresses the fundamental issues in traditional online gambling but also sets a new standard for what a decentralized gaming platform can achieve. Equito's technology is central to our mission of providing a fair, transparent, and user-centric gaming experience.

We look forward to the judges' feedback and are eager to continue our collaboration with Equito to revolutionize the online gaming industry.
